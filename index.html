  I am a Towers High School student and i hope to graduate in 2023; hopefully. In all my grade levels I have not failed any clases during high school and
  possibly getting 32 credits by the end of this senior year. While in high school I am also looking forward into a variety in colleges. Each college has
  different scholarships and programs to help you financially during your arrival at a campus. For me however I really look forward to Emory University
  and University of Georgia.

  My history can be a little messed up in a way that I was not raised in the most beautiful family in the world. Both my dad and my mom had very bad childhoods
  and were deeply in the bad sides of trailer parks and skeptical people. When it comes to me however and how I take that into consideration of how family will
  determine me, I ignore it. Knowing how I was not raised well it does not stop me in education, work, and fun. Im human just like everyone else and everyone
  grows up differently and is not always bad to be different.
